      <h2>Here's a time-line of Charles Darwin's life:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1809</strong> - Charles Darwin was born on February 12 in Shrewsbury, England.</li>

        <li><strong>1818</strong> - Attended Shrewsbury School, a boarding school known for its classical curriculum.</li>

        <li><strong>1825-1827</strong> - Enrolled at the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, but found it uninteresting and disturbing (due to surgery without anesthesia).</li>

        <li><strong>1828</strong> - Entered Christ’s College, Cambridge, intending to become a clergyman. During this time, he became deeply interested in natural science.</li>

        <li><strong>1831-1836</strong> - Darwin embarked on the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. The voyage, particularly his observations in the Galápagos Islands, profoundly influenced his thinking about species and their development.</li>

        <li><strong>1839</strong> - Published his journal from the Beagle expedition, "The Voyage of the Beagle", which brought him initial fame as a naturalist.</li>

        <li><strong>1839</strong> - Married his cousin, Emma Wedgwood. Together, they had 10 children, many of whom made significant contributions to various scientific fields.</li>

        <li><strong>1842</strong> - Moved to Down House in Kent, where Darwin would spend the rest of his life conducting research and writing.</li>

        <li><strong>1859</strong> - Published "On the Origin of Species", introducing the theory of natural selection. The book sparked widespread debate and transformed biology.</li>

        <li><strong>1871</strong> - Published "The Descent of Man", where he applied evolutionary theory to human evolution and emphasized the shared ancestry between humans and other animals.</li>

        <li><strong>1882</strong> - Darwin died on April 19 at the age of 73. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, an unusual honor for someone who challenged religious thought in such profound ways.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>"I am Darwin’s bulldog. I stand here in front of you as a knight-errant to do battle for him and his theory. If then the hypothesis of evolution is not true, what possible claim can science make to trustworthiness?"</em></p>
      <cite>--Thomas Huxley</cite>
